Some steps to take before getting this actually working:

1. Need to set some settings in mpi-site.xml in example_configuration/ folder:

Set yarn.mpi.scratch.dir value to hdfs://10.1.255.126:8020/nn/mpi-tmp (hdfs namenode)
Set yarn.mpi.ssh.authorizedkeys.path to /home/yarn/.ssh/authorized_keys

Also create the kown_hosts file

2. Copy the mpi-site.xml to /etc/hadoop/conf/
3. export HADOOP_USER_NAEME = hdfs (not sure if needed)
4. Make changes to MPIConfiguration.java file
set  DEFAULT_MPI_SCRATCH_DIR to hdfs://10.1.255.126:8020/group/dc/mpi-tmp (not sure?)
set DEFAULT_MPI_SSH_PUBLICKEY_ADDR to /home/hdfs/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (not sure?)
